Requirements:
    Challenge is to write a network capable Pong. Up to 4 player should be able to take part.
    Each one gets one side of the screen where the paddle can move. If there is less than 4 players the side is a ball reflecting wall.
    In case of explicit large code quotation please be so honest and state this clearly, because goal for us is to evaluate your work.

    One working day may not be enough to accomplish everything in every detail.

    In case you experience this then adopt the depth of certain aspects of your solution to the time and choose the focus yourself.
    Just outline the rest with some notes for example.

    For sending simply pack everything and give some short notes on the dependecies we need to fulfill when setting it up for a testrun.


Instructions:
    - run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    - edit the host in config.py to the host's IP address, if you want to play via LAN
    - start server with "python start_server.py"
    - add as many players as you want with "python start_client.py" (resets the game after 5 seconds)

Estimations:
    - Collision detection: 2 hours
    - Set up network capabilities: 4 hours
    - For everything else: 2 hours

Bugs:
    - If the ball hits the paddle in a certain way from the side, it gets stuck in an infinite loop

Possible features to be added:
    - Scoring system
    - Replace wall with paddle if player left
    - Choice of paddle for player

Notes:
    - Based a lot of the network code on https://github.com/techwithtim/network_game
    - It can be played by opening several local windows
    - I tried to set it up on another machine, to test it out completely, but it took too long to set up completely,
        so it is untested over LAN, but should work
